# STM32-Serial-I-O-I2C-Temperature-Sensor-and-SPI-Accelerometer-Interface
This project collection demonstrates interfacing with peripheral devices using UART, I2C, and SPI on the STM32L476 microcontroller. Each lab introduces a new communication protocol and its integration with sensors or output control, culminating in a full SPI accelerometer reader with UART output.
